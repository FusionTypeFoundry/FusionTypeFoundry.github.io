Fusion Type is an independent type foundry created by Brian Fuson and based in Knoxville, TN. I graduated from UTK in 2025 and have since dedicated my practice to designing and releasing original typefaces that combine clarity, character, and experimentation. My passion for typography grew out of graphic design and quickly evolved into building fonts that work equally well as reliable workhorse typefaces or as bold, expressive statements.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
Along the way I received the Entrepreneurial Promise Award, which allowed me to complete a type design certificate with the Letterform Archive. During that program I developed Bookwell, my first fully realized release, and it became the foundation for a growing catalog of modern typefaces. Since then, I’ve continued to push into experimental fonts, playful lettering systems, and custom font design projects.

        Fusion Type reflects a DIY mindset. This site was coded entirely by me in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the same hands-on approach shapes every part of the foundry—from motion graphics and testing environments to developing practical tools for other designers. The Tools page showcases resources like an ASCII generator and other utilities for creative exploration. The Column will feature writing on design process and the stories behind my typefaces, while random type projects highlights experiments, including my Undergraduate Specimen Zine retailing with Draw Down Books.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
        At its core, Fusion Type is about making typography accessible, forward-looking, and full of character. Whether you’re searching for experimental fonts, reliable modern typefaces, or inspiration through writing and tools, this foundry is built to support your creative work.
