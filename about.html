    <p>Fusion Type is an independent type foundry created by Brian Fuson (me) and based in Knoxville, TN. I am a current student at The University of Tennessee Knoxville and will graduate in May of 2025. I found my love for typography through my major, Graphic Design. Working unique fonts into my designs soon became my addiction. It didn’t take long before I was spending every minute outside of classes working on type projects. The typeface design process is simply like no other and I was hooked. I developed many bad designs, but each design was better as I learned. I soon came to the point that I was able to make what I wanted. My amazing professors soon caught on to my nasty habit of spending more time on personal type projects than my homework. They awarded this behavior with an “Entrepreneurial Promise” award. I used the awarded funds to take an online intro to type design course at The Letterform Archive. I developed Bookwell during this course. This brings us to where I’m at now. </p>
    <p>This foundry is where experimental and more typical fonts live together. I am an experimental person, so it will be reflected in my works. This foundry is (just going to be honest) ran the cheapest way I could possibly find. This led to many fun creative decisions. For example, this entire website was coded by me in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The graphic designer in me covers the rest of Fusion Type from motion graphics to a color palette. I am a very “DIY” person and love a chance to make everything from ground up. </p>
    <p>I started this whole project as a student, so I freshly know what it’s like wanting to use cool (pricy) fonts. Reach out to me at fusiontype.xyz@gmail.com if you want some type or have questions. If you notice anything off about a font, need more characters, or have business inquires, please reach out to me at fusiontype.xyz@gmail.com.</p>
